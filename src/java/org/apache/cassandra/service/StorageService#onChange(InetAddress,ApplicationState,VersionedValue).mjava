    /*
     * Handle the reception of a new particular ApplicationState for a particular endpoint. Note that the value of the
     * ApplicationState has not necessarily "changed" since the last known value, if we already received the same update
     * from somewhere else.
     *
     * onChange only ever sees one ApplicationState piece change at a time (even if many ApplicationState updates were
     * received at the same time), so we perform a kind of state machine here. We are concerned with two events: knowing
     * the token associated with an endpoint, and knowing its operation mode. Nodes can start in either bootstrap or
     * normal mode, and from bootstrap mode can change mode to normal. A node in bootstrap mode needs to have
     * pendingranges set in TokenMetadata; a node in normal mode should instead be part of the token ring.
     *
     * Normal progression of ApplicationState.STATUS values for a node should be like this:
     * STATUS_BOOTSTRAPPING,token
     *   if bootstrapping. stays this way until all files are received.
     * STATUS_NORMAL,token
     *   ready to serve reads and writes.
     * STATUS_LEAVING,token
     *   get ready to leave the cluster as part of a decommission
     * STATUS_LEFT,token
     *   set after decommission is completed.
     *
     * Other STATUS values that may be seen (possibly anywhere in the normal progression):
     * STATUS_MOVING,newtoken
     *   set if node is currently moving to a new token in the ring
     * STATUS_RELOCATING,srcToken,srcToken,srcToken,...
     *   set if the endpoint is in the process of relocating a token to itself
     * REMOVING_TOKEN,deadtoken
     *   set if the node is dead and is being removed by its REMOVAL_COORDINATOR
     * REMOVED_TOKEN,deadtoken
     *   set if the node is dead and has been removed by its REMOVAL_COORDINATOR
     *
     * Note: Any time a node state changes from STATUS_NORMAL, it will not be visible to new nodes. So it follows that
     * you should never bootstrap a new node during a removenode, decommission or move.
