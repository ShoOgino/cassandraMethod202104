    /**
     * Handle counter mutation on the coordinator host.
     *
     * A counter mutation needs to first be applied to a replica (that we'll call the leader for the mutation) before being
     * replicated to the other endpoint. To achieve so, there is two case:
     *   1) the coordinator host is a replica: we proceed to applying the update locally and replicate throug
     *   applyCounterMutationOnCoordinator
     *   2) the coordinator is not a replica: we forward the (counter)mutation to a chosen replica (that will proceed through
     *   applyCounterMutationOnLeader upon receive) and wait for its acknowledgment.
     *
     * Implementation note: We check if we can fulfill the CL on the coordinator host even if he is not a replica to allow
     * quicker response and because the WriteResponseHandlers don't make it easy to send back an error. We also always gather
     * the write latencies at the coordinator node to make gathering point similar to the case of standard writes.
