                       is only gossiping to a subset of the seeds.

                       The most straightforward check would be to check that all the seeds have been
                       verified either as live or unreachable.  To avoid that computation each round,
                       we reason that:

                       either all the live nodes are seeds, in which case non-seeds that come online
                       will introduce themselves to a member of the ring by definition,

                       or there is at least one non-seed node in the list, in which case eventually
                       someone will gossip to it, and then do a gossip to a random seed from the
                       gossipedToSeed check.
