        // recording the timestamp IN BETWEEN those actions. Any sstables created
        // with this timestamp or greater time, will not be marked for delete.
        //
        // Bonus complication: since we store replay position in sstable metadata,
        // truncating those sstables means we will replay any CL segments from the
        // beginning if we restart before they are discarded for normal reasons
        // post-truncate.  So we need to (a) force a new segment so the currently
        // active one can be discarded, and (b) flush *all* CFs so that unflushed
        // data in others don't keep any pre-truncate CL segments alive.
        //
        // Bonus bonus: simply forceFlush of all the CF is not enough, because if
        // for a given column family the memtable is clean, forceFlush will return
        // immediately, even though there could be a memtable being flush at the same
        // time.  So to guarantee that all segments can be cleaned out, we need
