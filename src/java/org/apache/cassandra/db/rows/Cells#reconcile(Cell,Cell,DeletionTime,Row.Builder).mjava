     * Reconciles/merges two cells, one being an update to an existing cell,
     * yielding index updates if appropriate.

     * Note that this method assumes that the provided cells can meaningfully
     * be reconciled together, that is that those cells are for the same row and same
     * column (and same cell path if the column is complex).
     * <p>
     * Also note that which cell is provided as {@code existing} and which is
     * provided as {@code update} matters for index updates.
     *
     * @param existing the pre-existing cell, the one that is updated. This can be
     * {@code null} if this reconciliation correspond to an insertion.
     * @param update the newly added cell, the update. This can be {@code null} out
     * of convenience, in which case this function simply copy {@code existing} to
     * {@code writer}.
     * @param deletion the deletion time that applies to the cells being considered.
     * This deletion time may delete both {@code existing} or {@code update}.
     * @param builder the row builder to which the result of the reconciliation is written.
     *
     * @return the timestamp delta between existing and update, or {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} if one
     * of them is {@code null} or deleted by {@code deletion}).
