     * Whether we can use the clustering values in the stats of the sstable to build the lower bound.
     * <p>
     * Currently, the clustering values of the stats file records for each clustering component the min and max
     * value seen, null excluded. In other words, having a non-null value for a component in those min/max clustering
     * values does _not_ guarantee that there isn't an unfiltered in the sstable whose clustering has either no value for
     * that component (it's a prefix) or a null value.
     * <p>
     * This is problematic as this means we can't in general build a lower bound from those values since the "min"
     * values doesn't actually guarantee minimality.
     * <p>
     * However, we can use those values if we can guarantee that no clustering in the sstable 1) is a true prefix and
     * 2) uses null values. Nat having true prefixes means having no range tombstone markers since rows use
     * {@link Clustering} which is always "full" (all components are always present). As for null values, we happen to
     * only allow those in compact tables (for backward compatibility), so we can simply exclude those tables.
     * <p>
     * Note that the information we currently have at our disposal make this condition less precise that it could be.
     * In particular, {@link SSTableReader#mayHaveTombstones} could return {@code true} (making us not use the stats)
     * because of cell tombstone or even expiring cells even if the sstable has no range tombstone markers, even though
     * it's really only markers we want to exclude here (more precisely, as said above, we want to exclude anything
     * whose clustering is not "full", but that's only markers). It wouldn't be very hard to collect whether a sstable
     * has any range tombstone marker however so it's a possible improvement.
