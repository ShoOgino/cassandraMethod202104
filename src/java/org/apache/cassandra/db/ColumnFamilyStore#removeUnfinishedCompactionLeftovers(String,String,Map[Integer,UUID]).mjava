    /**
     * Replacing compacted sstables is atomic as far as observers of DataTracker are concerned, but not on the
     * filesystem: first the new sstables are renamed to "live" status (i.e., the tmp marker is removed), then
     * their ancestors are removed.
     *
     * If an unclean shutdown happens at the right time, we can thus end up with both the new ones and their
     * ancestors "live" in the system.  This is harmless for normal data, but for counters it can cause overcounts.
     *
     * To prevent this, we record sstables being compacted in the system keyspace.  If we find unfinished
     * compactions, we remove the new ones (since those may be incomplete -- under LCS, we may create multiple
     * sstables from any given ancestor).
