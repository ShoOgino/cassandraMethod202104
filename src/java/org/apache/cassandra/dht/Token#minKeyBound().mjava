     * A token corresponds to the range of all the keys having this token.
     * A token is thus no comparable directly to a key. But to be able to select
     * keys given tokens, we introduce two "fake" keys for each token T:
     *   - lowerBoundKey: a "fake" key representing the lower bound T represents.
     *                    In other words, lowerBoundKey is the smallest key that
     *                    have token T.
     *   - upperBoundKey: a "fake" key representing the upper bound T represents.
     *                    In other words, upperBoundKey is the largest key that
     *                    have token T.
     *
     * Note that those are "fake" keys and should only be used for comparison
     * of other keys, for selection of keys when only a token is known.
